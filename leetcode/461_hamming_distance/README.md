# 461. Hamming Distance
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance" target="_blank">Hamming distance</a> between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, return *the **Hamming distance** between them*.




**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

```
**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = 3, y = 1
Output: 1

```



**Constraints:**

* <code>0 <=
x, y <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>
