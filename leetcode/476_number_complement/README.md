# 476. Number Complement
The **complement** of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the <code>0</code>'s to <code>1</code>'s and all the <code>1</code>'s to <code>0</code>'s in its binary representation.

* For example, The integer <code>5</code> is <code>"101"</code> in binary and its **complement** is <code>"010"</code> which is the integer <code>2</code>.
Given an integer <code>num</code>, return *its complement*.




**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

```
**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

```



**Constraints:**

* <code>1 <= num < 2<sup>31</sup></code>
