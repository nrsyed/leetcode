# 9. Palindrome Number
Given an integer <code>x</code>, return <code>true</code> if <code>x</code> is palindrome integer.

An integer is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backward as forward.

* For example, <code>121</code> is a palindrome while <code>123</code> is not.



**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

```
**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

```
**Example 3:**

```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

```



**Constraints:**

* <code>-2<sup>31</sup>
<= x <= 2<sup>31</sup>
- 1</code>
