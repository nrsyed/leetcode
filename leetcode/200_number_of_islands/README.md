# 200. Number of Islands
Given an <code>m x n</code> 2D binary grid <code>grid</code> which represents a map of <code>'1'</code>s (land) and <code>'0'</code>s (water), return *the number of islands*.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.




**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

```
**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3

```



**Constraints:**

* <code>m == grid.length</code>
* <code>n == grid[i].length</code>
* <code>1 <= m, n <= 300</code>
* <code>grid[i][j]</code> is <code>'0'</code> or <code>'1'</code>.
